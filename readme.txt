# Django_URLScreenShot
Screenshot + api + TDD

In this Django Project I am going to:
1. Get Screenshots from a specific Web URL : www.webcenter4u.com (app name: myshots)
2. Save to PostgreSQL database the provided images from step 1.
3. View that database fields with an api (app name: myapi)
4. Test Screenshot Application with Pytest

As first commit I send all project and as second I comment My Error lines, but in this case Step 1 and 4 work as well.

My Errors:
1. myshots/views.py/,Line4 : # from .models import *
2. myapi/view and /urls.py : Fetching img from db in api


Also requirement.txt is in root for install Packages and tools
